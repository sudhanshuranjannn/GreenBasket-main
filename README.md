2) Keep in mind that you must have the xammp downloaded and set-up to run the php code.
3) You must unzip the `css`, `images` and `js` folder and copy the folder with the same name, where you copy all the code to run the website successfully.
4) Open the `Login.php` file in the web browser.
5) Add the sql database name ("shop_db") in the mysql page of the admin of the xampp folder and copy the file in the htdocs folder of the xampp folder of the windows c drive folder.
